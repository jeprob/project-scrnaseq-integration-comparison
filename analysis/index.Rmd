This project explores three different data integration methods for multiple single-cell RNAseq datasets and compares the integration results e.g. by cell clustering.

The methods compared are:  

* [Seurat v3](https://jeprob.github.io/project-scrnaseq-integration-comparison/analysiswithseurat.html)  
* [Conos](https://jeprob.github.io/project-scrnaseq-integration-comparison/analysiswithconos.html)
* [Harmony](https://jeprob.github.io/project-scrnaseq-integration-comparison/analysiswithseurat.html)
